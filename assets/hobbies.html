        <li>Reading: <br> I am currently in the process of reading the cormac macarthy classic, Blood Meridian.<br> It is quite a tough read that explores the nature of sensless violence and humanity.</li>

        I am hoping to continue learning and reading about this topic as i think it is a great way to store food and add flavour to things that can be otherwise a little bit boring. The book I am using right now can be found <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Noma-Guide-Fermentation-Foundations-Flavor/dp/1579657184/ref=asc_df_1579657184/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=310762441626&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=16679373564773143000&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1007850&hvtargid=pla-446680079209&psc=1&th=1&psc=1">Here</a>
